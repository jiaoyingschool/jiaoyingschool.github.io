	  <p class="nav_title">JiaoYing Chinese Culture &amp; Art School was founded in 1997, as the 2006 Fall   term begins, it is our 10th anniversary. Starting with 20 students and 2   teachers. Since then, our school has be developing steadily,  thanks to our great reputation in art and language education and to the fast growing Chinese  community in the Portland area.  </pre>
    <p class="nav_title"> As Oregonian reports, local Chinese American parents find   that two schools greatly help their kids to straddle two cultures, one is their   regular public school and one is Jiao Ying Chinese Culture &amp; Art School. I   would like to quote what Pei Pei Zhang said in the report: “Having the other   language gives you a different perspective. It is a tool to broaden one’s   thinking”. </p>
    <p class="nav_title">In addition to the art and language education, Jiao Ying   Chinese Culture &amp; Art School is actively involved in a lot of events for   diversity promotion and culture exchange.  </p>
    <p class="nav_title">As you know, Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, is the   most important holiday for Chinese Community. PSU-CSSA and Jiao Ying Chinese   Culture and Art School co-organize a grand high-level celebration party every   year, which is held at the ballroom of Smith Center. Most of the performers are   from our school and we provide all the equipment to decorate the stage and the   room. About 1000 audience are attracted every year to the party. The consular   from the Chinese General Consulate at San Francisco, top managers of PSU, as   well as city and state officials are invited to the annual party. It is the   largest event for the Chinese Community in the Portland area and is an important   platform for culture communication. </p>
    <p class="nav_title">Our school is one of the organizers for annual Mid-Autumn   Festival parade held in Chinese Garden and China Town. Chinese folk dance   performed by our students is a longtime highlight of annual Asian Festival held   in Portland Expo Center. </p>
    <p class="nav_title">JiaoYing Chinese Culture &amp; Art School   has become a successful educator for Chinese community, an important   contributor to City of Portland and a friendly bridge between Chinese and   American cultures.</p>
