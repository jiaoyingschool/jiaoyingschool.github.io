README for the protected/images directory
Steve Kneizys

This directory, protected/images, is a secondary images directory.  It is
used for two major purposes.

1) The manager.cgi program needs to know where it's images are, so they
are placed here and the code self-serves them.

2) For commerce.cgi secure pages, images for buttons are more easily
self-served by placing them here rather than setting variables for a
secure server directory or hard-coding things in various locations.  

The images in this directory may be displayed in either secure or normal 
mode.
