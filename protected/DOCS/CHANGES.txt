AGORACART History Log  (Newest to oldest - see CHANGES_old.txt for Pre- 3.3 version changes)

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0K2 Standard
(06-MAR-2003)

added password manager

minor edits to manager.cgi so custom manager libs load after standard items

updated index.html (main store page) so that headers and footers are updated
automatically using the basica store header/footer editor.  Also added links to
various resources on this page as well.

Authorize.net SIM intergration completed

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0K Standard
(20-NOV-2002)

Second version produced under the K-Factor Technologies, Inc. distributions.
standard name evolving to AgoraCart.  Version 4.0J was too buggy for release.

Money symbols and placement management added to main settings screen.

Frontpage.html file renamed index.html and moved from html/main
sub directory up to the html sub-directory (bascially moved up one level).

ability to add about us, contact us, warranty, privacy policy html pages
to the html directory and have it indexed with agorascript in agora parsed
pages.  "_" characters are taken out for auto generated names used in the
link names so that a file named "About_Us.html" will show a link name of
"About Us" yet still have the correct file name in the URL link.  Only html
and htm files are displayed.  Hard coded flinks can be done with the
cartlink=pagename.html added to the URL.

"main" directory renamed to forms.  Only order forms are in this directory now.

Distribution copies split into developer and Standard versions.  developer
versions available with comments and notes and only available in the Pro
and Developer user forums/areas.

Distributions also split into two main versions: standard based on version
4.0H and SSI based on 4.0i pre-release.

DOCS directory moved to a sub-directory of protected area.

Changes.txt file moved to the DOCS directory and split into two portions.

WRAPPER directory moved to a sub-directory of protected area.

"Handling Charge added to to order if shipping total is zero" variable defined
in the shipping settings manager (formerly in the agora.setup.db file). 
basically, if shipping is $0, do you want to add the handling fee anyway?
Now in the shipping manager area.  Default is "no"

Ability to send orders to two email addresses added to the main settings
area.  NOTE: some hosting services may require both email addresses to
be to the same domain for security and anti-spamming purposes.  If this
is the case, setup a forwarding address on the same domain name to
forward orders to the email address you need to use.

Ability to set variable for generated database based html product pages.
Default is "maybe" which allows you to generate database product pages
unless a specific ppinc page is specified.  "No" will allow you to only
generate pages from database entries.  Say "yes" if running an
HTML-based store and you never want to use database generated
product pages.

Ability to set a variable if you want the customer to view the cart contents
after adding an item to the cart. Default is "no" which takes the customer
back to the database generated product page they were originally at with
a thank you message generated towards the top of the page. Say "yes" if
running an HTML-based store and you DO NOT want to the customer to
go to a database generated product page.

(Pro Version only) 5 extra User Defined Database Fields.  "User10" will be
dedicated to the Inventory Control add-on, but only if you use the IC
add-on.  Otherwise you can use the User10 field for whatever you wish.
Database manager automatically detects a previous commercecgi and
agora 3.x thru 4.0i standard data.file as well as "standard 4.0j" distributions
and allows you to convert it by a
click of the database link.  After the database has been updated, the
regular database manager link shows up on the manager menus.
NOTE: Public release remains 5 user fields at this time.

Ability to convert Web Store 1.02 database files removed from SSI versions

Moved many layout items to the store manager.  New manager called
Layout Manager created. Layout Manager is plugNplay like other managers.

Added fixed link to DOCS directory

Step one of Check Out Process can now be defined in the main settings area
of the store manager.  This will allow you to view the check out forms in
SSL mode.  If not using SSL, leave the field blank.  Supports SSL on your
domain name and on Shared SSL as long as ownership remains the same.

(Public Release Only) Debug Mode setting removed from store manager.
Must be manually set now.  (Pro versions: still enabled in store manager)

Fixed Netscape 4.x problems at check out with some forms not showing (from version i).

fixed minor multiple gateway problems.

fixed order number differences in the emails and the ones shown on the confirmation
page of the offline processing areas - the same number shows up in all the places needed.

sample city tax logic included in custom tax logic area.

Header and Footer editor added for the basic design included in the distribution.

Length of image info expanded in product editors within the store manager area.

Fixed bug in Offline, AgoraPay, and iTransact ordering processes.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0i-pre#2
(02-Apr-2002)

Starting to deal with SSI type store issues a bit more extensively.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0h
(01-Feb-2002)

Updated error logging code in agora, added &update_error_log routine to
the manager (somehow it was totally missing!)

The security filtering was updated.  Versions 4.0d through 4.0g can become 
'fully operational' by using security_10242002.pl and the manager.cgi file 
from this distribution, no need for a full upgrade, minimal changes!

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0g
(29-Jan-2002)

Turned off 'versions' command for stores not in debug mode.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0f
(27-Jan-2002)

Updated meta character filtering.  With the variations on agorascript that
any site might implement, this pre-filtering helps make sites safer.  
This pre-filtering is also implemented in secutity_01242002.pl and the
ashim40update.pl files.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0e
(25-Jan-2002)

Added error checking and recovery code for < and > on input from the 
browser.  Escapes the < and > for display of cart_id changes in debug 
mode to the screen.  

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0d
(01-Jan-2002)

Created the %%Load_Option_File <filename>%% tag.

Turned off the cart id tracking by default, some stores in development
have problems with it.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0c
(27-Dec-2001)

Removed the 'ZCODE' from the cart, some older versions of perl had trouble
with too many eval statements (running the same eval a second time often
worked, so it was definitely a perl problem.)  It did speed up the cart 
but made it less stable on some platforms, so it had to go.

Add the %%QtyBox%% token, moved the loading of the option file to the
productPage.inc file to before the agorascript-pre is run.  Added optional
modifier tags to %%QtyBox%%, %%prodID%% and %%itemID%% tokens.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0b
(16-Dec-2001)

Updated the ragora.cgi program.

Updated the picserve.cgi to use binmode for pictures to support running 
on win/dos servers.

Added special variable options processing, the cart user1 field is now 
dedicated to this purpose.  Set $sc_disable_variable_options='yes' to 
disable this option.  The first item in each of the sample store 
categories uses a variable discount option file.

Modified the referring validation to allow it to be disabled.

Updated the add to cart philosophy to re-enable the ability to add 
multiple items at a time that was accidently removed with 4.0's "add only 
one of anything to the cart" philosophy.

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0a
(7-Dec-2001)

Changed logging access to the store such that each unique shopping session
is logged instead of just when shopping cart id cookies are initially
assigned.

The AgoraPay gateway is included in the base distribution.

Added routines for the order libraries to add to top/bottom of emails.

New code for the 'agora' hash added for server-side cookies of sorts, 
sees the DOCS directory for specifics on how to use them for 
compatability with past and future versions of the shopping cart.

The '_TRANSLOG' files are no longer used, instead info is kept as a string
in the '_COOKIES' file so the disk IO is similar to before the addition 
of the cookies file.

Free form logic 'ext' file has been updated, now there are two places 
where the logic is run.

Added variable $sc_add_handling_cost_if_shipping_is_zero, set to 'yes' if 
need to add handling cost if shipping is zero.

Added provisions for displaying the cart table using the 'verified' values 
instead of having to recalculate them (useful for display of everything on 
a post-order confirmation page, used in current Offline order library.)

Fixed the manager cookies (domain definition and cookie expiration were 
incorrect.)

***************************************************************************
Version 4.0 
(10-Nov-2001)

Changes to manager database import/export routines and updates to the 
agora flatfile database library.

Added the 'relay' form item check to enhance ragora.cgi wrapper 
alternative program.

Fixed the agora order lib to display names on text of cart properly.

Changed the major gateway order libs so the email return address for
'admin' emails is the 'site admin' email (to hopefully make mailing the
actual order to multiple emails work better.)

Moved a few procedures out of agora.cgi and into the order lib.  Changed
much of the code so that is is only compiled on demand, and if the code
generates a compilation error then it is logged with agora instead of just
in the 'server logs'.

Added a new email library that uses the more modern "Mail::Sendmail" perl
module that may be optionally used in the event that sendmail is not 
available on your system.

Cart now only adds 'one' of anything, if a second addition is made then 
the quantity is adjusted.  Also, the cart is now sorted when written to 
disk (and thus when displayed) by the cart row fields between the quantity 
and unique identifier.

Updated load_cart_copy routine and added save_cart_copy routine.

Shims have been updated for use of 4.0 routines and libraries.

All manager 'ext' files should be compatable with 3.3j or earlier with the
proper shim(s) loaded.

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3j
(18-Sep-2001)

Changes to sample store -- search in header now searches on word 
boundaries using exact_match=on, and the category agorascript on the 
frontpage uses it as well (xm= same as exact_match.) 

Updated Offline gateway to fix check processing.

Added manager support for large databases.  Flatfile database library 
updated to sort results of searches by key id.  

Gateway management removed from inside the manager code and agora.cgi
itself, execution is now via code hooks.  Upgrades to gateways are 
simplified.  Also, many manager functions are now in extension files.

A 'shim' is being made available to pro forum members to bring 3.3d-3.3i
managers up to 3.3j specs if someone does not want to simply update the
entire manager.  New manager extensions will operate on the older managers
with the shim loaded.  A shim for the main program is also available to
pro forum members. 

Item options are now shown in a sorted order on the screen, and are
placed in the cart that way.  If you have more than 9 options, consider 
using numbers with leading zero(s) and a fixed length (say 2 characters) 
so the sort order will be preserved.

The value of each box in the SBW module is now tracked in the 'shipping
thing' string.

Added %%eval()%% to html pages.

There are now 'virtual fields' routines!  They are used for display of
shopping cart items in email and the web, but can be used in other places
as well.

Added @db and @cart arrays that describe the data field names, similar to 
the %db and %cart variables.

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3i (h,g were pre-release test versions)
(23-APR-2001)

Updated manager to default to single login mode if cookies are not enabled
in the manager.cgi program or the cookie settings are incorrect.

Scrambling of the CC info on local disk is now configureable from the
manager (Offline lib is the only standard lib that uses it at this time).

Added umask 0077 code to upgrade security on files being written to by the
cart and manager, force umask 0022 for writing of .htaccess and
manager.access files.

Fixed the manager bug whereby the '*' was accidently incorporated into new
products.

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3f 
(20-JAN-2001)

Manager was updated to allow multiple simultaneous users from different IP
addresses.  The "*" char is now used to denote that a record ID should
determined once editing has been submitted byt the web browser.  This is
used for "add" as well as "edit" of product database records.  The "*" can
be used by itself as the only part of the ID, or at the end of the ID. 
Clearing the order log does not check for simultaneous persons viewing and
clearing the log, be careful! 

Various speed enhancements, no bug fixes from 3.3e. Some routines were
moved into the order lib from the html lib so that the cart runs faster.

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3e
(08-JAN-2001)

Added IP tracking and "reload protection" on order forms.

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3d
(07-JAN-2001)

Added the %%eval()%% token for product page inc files.

Changed the manager so that the agora_user_lib.pl has sections to it.  The
old cart and pgp user libs are no longer required as separate files.  It
is now much easier to manage smaller sections of the configuration, and
there is less startup IO with less files.

To add a custom, user managed settings section in the agora_user_lib.pl
file you should name your section starting with the letter X and put it at
the bottom of the file just above the 1; part.  For example, until the
manager handles custom taxes you may want to edit them yourself:

#:#:#: start XCUSTOM_TAX settings
 $sc_extra_tax1_logic='(0.04)*$subtotal';
 $sc_extra_tax1_name='Philly Tax';
#:#:#: end XCUSTOM_TAX settings
1;

Each time the agora_user_lib.pl file is updated by the manager the section
names will be "upcased" and sorted in alphabetical order. 

Added verification to the option files.

Added ability to view the order log in the manager.  If an order comes in
after "view order log" but before "clear order log", then the new order
will still be in the log. 

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3c
(19-DEC-2000)

Added the $eform_xxx and $eform{xxx} style vales to complement the
$vform_xxx and $vform{xxx} vars (xxx is any form data variable).  The
eform vars have single and double quotes escaped to &quot; for display on
web pages.  The vform vars should always be used for data processing.

Updated the agorascript processing.  Cart footers processing updated.

Added 5 new fields to the cart itself (i.e. old carts in the shopping
carts directory are obsolete!)  The numbers of the options ordered are 
maintained, and there are three user fields in the cart itself.  There
is also a flag that can be used for special shipping calculations,
eventually it will be integrated with the SBW module.

Fixed pad length in the manager.  Set it to 4 for 1000-9999 products in
the catalog, or 5 for 10000 to 99999 products, etc.  A safe number is
probably 4 or 5.  Set it to 0 to not pad the product id #'s with leading
zeros.

Removed support for PayPal.  Their support and interface were too
unreliable for inclusion here.  There are plenty of hacks out there for
use with PayPal, check commerce.cgi support forum in addition to the
commerce.cgi and agoracgi.com mailing list archives.

Added the ability to clear the order form _VERIFY file and re-display a
blank order form.  Upon a "reload" of an order form page the CC info is
now blanked out. 

Added serveral more code hooks for optional modules or custom libraries.

Added another DOC on having taxes computed for only selected items in the
catalog. 

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3b
(13-DEC-2000)

Added a few touches to the options agorascript, added a few more code
hooks for use with the cart's construction.  After items are added to the
cart then a custom library and/or agorascript within the option(s) 
file(s) can be used to change the cart navigation, handle inventory
control, or perform other functions.

For options files, in addition to the standard "pre" and "post"
agorascript, you may also choose "add-to-cart" (if that item is added to
the cart it is activated) or "add-to-cart-opt-#" (if option number # was
selected the agorascript code is run.)

***************************************************************************
Version 3.3a
(08-DEC-2000)

Changes to the order libraries, and the database library.  Minor bug
fixes to Offline library, additional security features installed.

Added "pickup" setting for UPS in the manager instead of forcing folks
to modify the script directly.  (Note: UPS code still does not add extra
insurance for expensive packages.)

Any fields on the order form that have _XCOMMENT_ as part of the name,
such as 

  Ecom_XCOMMENT_Special_Notes

will be included at the bottom of the emails.  The field name part after 
_XCOMMENT_ is parsed such that the appropriate section of the email will
be marked as "Special Notes".  To ensure that the come out in the order
since they are sorted you could call them things like:

  Ecom_a_XCOMMENT_Special_Notes
  Ecom_b_XCOMMENT_Gift_Card_Note

And the first one, Ecom_a_XCOMMENT_Special_Notes, would come out first
since it will sort first.

Added a new kind of agorascript for the order forms.  Before the order
form has any processing done at all, the agorascript of type "orderform"
can be used (in addition to the usual "pre" and "post" style), as in:

	<!--agorascript-orderform 
	  (your statements go here!) 
	-->

Agorascript has also been added for options files.
