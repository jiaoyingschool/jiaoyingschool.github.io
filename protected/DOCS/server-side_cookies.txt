The 'agora' server side cookie
------------------------------
November 21, 2001

Server side cookies allow the storing of a value on the server.
Before implementation of such cookies, variables had to either be
sent back and forth each transaction or stored on browser side
cookies.  Sometimes browser cide cookies are turned off, making
tracking much more difficult.  If the variables are not properly
passed back and forth then they can be lost, so the server side
cookies solve both of these problems.

There is some added overhead with disk IO and storage on the 
server, but it is minor.  Since 'transaction logging' was already
implemented to prevent page reloads causing problems with multiple
additions to the cart, such disk IO is already present in the 
shopping cart.  For version 4.0a and higher, transaction logging 
is done via the server-side cookies so the disk IO overhead is 
minimized.

For example, server side cookies can be used to set a refer 
variable such that it is set only the first time it is encountered 
but persists thereafter.  The code required to accomplish a task 
such as this should look something like this:

  if ($form_data{'refer'} ne '') {
    if (&get_agora('refer') eq '') {
      &set_agora('refer',$form_data{'refer'});
     }
   }
  $x_refer = &get_agora('refer');

This can be simplified by using the 'ain_agora' routine, add-if-new, 
which does the same thing but is a little easier to code.  The arguments 
to sin_agora are the same as set_agora, first is cookie name and second is 
value, and only stores if the cookie is new and the value is not null:

  &ain_agora('refer',$form_data{'refer'});
  $x_refer = &get_agora('refer');

If you want to detect if a server-side cookie has changed value
since it was loaded, the chk_agora routine does than by returning
'1' if it is the same, null otherwise.  For example:

  if (&chk_agora('my_cookie_name')) {
    print "It is the same!\n";
   } else {
    print "It is different!\n";
   }

Once you are done with a server-side cookie, you can delete it by
setting it to a null string:

  &set_agora('refer','');

Server-side cookies will automatically expire at the same rate
the shopping carts do, as they are found in the same directory.

Internally, the variable is currently stored in a hash called
%agora.  The routines &set_agora, &get_agora and &chk_agora allow
for compatability with older (pre 3.2k) stores as well as any 
future updates to the server-side cookies methodology. 

You will need to be running agora version 4.0a or higher or have 
the ashim40update.pl installed in the store/custom directory to 
be able to use server-side cookies.

By convention, all 'official' cookies used will be in all caps, so 
all lowercase cookies are 'user' cookies.
