Using the send-mail-lib.pl file
-------------------------------
Sept 30, 2001


Sometimes the sendmail program is not available on your unix host, in that 
case there are two other mail libraries.

The first is 'smtpmail-lib.pl', which has the drawback that it will not 
work in 100% of the cases.  It is included here for historical purposes.

The other one is send-mail-lib.pl, written to use the perl module 
Mail::Sendmail, and requires two setup varaibles.  First, in the 
agora.setup.db file, find the line:

  $sc_mail_lib_path = "$sc_lib_dir/mail-lib.pl";

Change it to point to the send-mail-lib.pl library, and also add a line to 
set the name of the smtp host if 'localhost' will not work for you, as in: 

  $sc_mail_lib_path = "$sc_lib_dir/send-mail-lib.pl";
  $smtp_host = "my.host.here.com";

(These variable can also be set using the 'free form logic' option.) 

This library requires the MIME and Mail modules be installed at your web 
hosting company, but if they are not some backup versions are included 
with the standard distribution in the store/library/additions directory, 
where agora.cgi 4.0 will find it automatically if your perl installation 
does not already have it.
