CODEHOOKS
===========
July 5, 2000

The "codehooks" feature has been tested and updated a bit.  This will
allow for seperate modules to be optionally added to the base code (things
like inventory control, customer and affiliate tracking, etc.) without
having to actually patch the base code to allow for it. 

For example, to add a routine that is run everytime the store starts, you
would write a library and place it in the "custom" directory (and make it
executeable ... agora will detect and auto-load it.)  Upon library
initialization, it would need to run the add_coodehook routine to add it's
subroutines to be run at the appropriate times.  To run a routine called
track_aff everytime the store started, you could hook in like this: 

&add_codehook("open_for_business","track_aff");

and the sub track_aff will be run when the script execution reaches the
open_for_business code hook location. The code hooks are not documented
yet (may never be, who has time!), but you can search for them throughout
the code, and feel free to suggest where to place others that you need as
you develop libraries. 

So if a library called mycustom.pl consisted of:

    # My library
    &add_codehook("open_for_business","track_aff");
    
    sub track_aff {
        print "Got Here!<br>\n";
       }

     1; #we are a library

and were placed in the custom directory and made executeable, then it
would print "Got Here!" at the top of every page.  Of course you would
have to add more meaningful code. 

There can be more than one code hook installed at any given location, they
will be executed one at a time in the order they were added.
